### IndividualProject

The Individual Enterprise Java Project is designed to facilitate a student’s transition from Madison College to an industry career though the development of a high-quality software product. The project will encourage students to think critically and solve challenging problems while developing skills critical to a successful career in Information Technology.  Upon completion, this project will be an important part of the student’s portfolio to be shared with potential employers.   

#### Objectives

* Create an innovative, data-driven Java web site or application that solves a problem of interest to the student.
* Demonstrate effective use of the technologies and techniques learned in the program, with emphasis on Enterprise Java topics including security, logging, unit testing, Java frameworks/libraries, web services, and database.
* Incorporate a minimum of one technology/library/framework/tool that requires independent research (a topic not covered in class).
* Demonstrate proper use of UI elements to create a visually pleasing application.
* Create a well-structured Java project.
* Use version control.
* Demonstrate the ability to effectively plan project work and execute that plan.
* Document the process and progress of the project.
* Articulate the application architecture and explain the technologies used.

#### Deliverables

* Problem statement and project plan (detailed schedule for your project). Due Week 3. Must be approved by instructor.
* Complete at least 3 design/code reviews with at least 2 peers and the instructor.
* Regular (minimum of weekly) journal/blog/wiki entries documenting progress, obstacles, findings, learning points.
* Source code, HTML JavaDoc and all supporting materials published on GitHub.
* Present completed project to the class. Demonstrate the application, explain the application architecture and discuss significant technical aspects of the project with emphasis on your independent research technology. 

#### Rubric

| Category  | Excellent |   Good    |   Fair    |   Poor    |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Project effectively utilizes the technologies and techniques specified in the project objectives (35%)| Completely fulfills or exceeds project scope. (31-35) | Fulfilled most of the scope. (28-31) | Fulfilled some significant portions of the project scope. (21-28) | Barely fulfilled the scope: significant portions are missing. (0-21) |
| Synthesis of multiple concepts in unfamiliar situations requiring research beyond the scope of the class. (10%) | Experiments individually, exhibits independence and drive, shows originality in the solution. (9-10) | Experiments on own with reliance on instructor or others for guidance. (8-9) | Attempted with heavy reliance on instructor for recommendations and help. (6-8) | No observable interest or effort shown. (0-6) |
| Code is readable, documented, efficient and well-tested. (15%) | Code is exceptionally well organized and easy to follow. Documentation is well written and clearly explains what the code is accomplishing and how. Code is extremely efficient without sacrificing readability/maintainability. Code has significant test coverage. (14-15) |  Code is fairly easy to follow. Documentation is somewhat useful in understanding the code. Code is efficient. Moderate test coverage. (12-14) | Code is fairly easy to follow with some exceptions. Documentation is incomplete. Code inefficiencies exist. Some test coverage. (9-12) | Code is poorly organized; documentation is simply embedded comments and does not help the reader understand the code; code is unnecessarily long and complex. Little to no test coverage. (0-9) |
| Demonstrates initiative and thoughtful planning to leverage available resources (time, equipment, external expertise) and meet milestones. (10%) | Demonstrates initiative and thoughtful planning to leverage available resources; intermediate milestones were met. (9-10) | Demonstrates some initiative and leverages an available resource; an intermediate milestone might have been missed slightly. (8-9) | Demonstrates some planning but missed milestones. (6-8) | Appears to have involved minimal planning, missed milestones or failed to reach potential due to underutilized resources. (0-6) |
| Evidence of significant revision and incorporation of feedback. (10%) | Evidence of significant revision and incorporation of feedback that results in significant improvement. (9-10) | Evidence of some revision and incorporation of feedback that results in some improvement. (8-9) | Evidence of minor revision only and incorporation of feedback that results in minimal improvement. (6-8) | Project appears to have undergone little to no revision or incorporation of feedback. (0-6) |  
| Complexity (10%) | Complex (9-10) | Difficult (8-9) | Average (6-8) | Simple (0-6) |
| Final Presentation (10%) | Presentation is engaging, delivered with enthusiasm, relevant, comprehensive and clear. Uses aids that are effective and innovative. Demonstrates a high level of technical understanding. Manages the presentation time well. (9-10) | Presentation is well-delivered, smooth, relevant and understandable. Supporting materials are effectively used. Able to explain most technical concepts. (8-9) | Audience is able to follow the presentation, but there are minor disconnects in the flow or presentation is heavily scripted. Supporting materials are used and explained in context. Able to explain some technicalities. (6-8) | Presentation is difficult to follow, flow could be improved. Supporting materials are used, but not explained or in the proper context. Able to explain only a few technicalities. Presentation time is poorly managed. (0-6) |
