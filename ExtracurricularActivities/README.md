### Extracurricular Activities

Extracurricular activities options are included to encourage students to explore IT opportunities and experiences  outside of the classroom. Students will share their experience and learnings with their peers through a presentation about each activity s/he completes. These shareouts will also provide students with an opportunity to practice their presentation skills.

Students will complete two of the following, i.e., students may complete one volunteer activity and one professional development activity of their choice):

**Volunteer/Mentor** activities give students a chance to use their IT skills to help others: to be the expert in the room. Learning is often enhanced through the act of teaching or coaching. In addition, volunteering/mentoring increases self-confidence, self-esteem, and provides satisfaction in helping others. 

**Professional Development** activities are an important part of any IT professional's life. Participation in events like user group meetings and conferences not only provides an opportunity to learn more about a technology or related topic, but also to network with others in the field.

**Technical Research** activities allow students to practice effectively researching and implementing a tool/technology/technique to solve a problem. This activity is offered for students who may have difficulty scheduling  volunteer or professional development activities, or who have a very strong interest in exploring a unique technology topic on their own. 

**Craft Your Own Activity** If there something you would like to complete as an extracurricular activity that does not fit into one of the categories above, please propose your idea to your instructor.

We will discuss several options for each activity in class.  

#### Deliverables

* Present each experience and related learnings to the class in a 10-20 minute presentation.
