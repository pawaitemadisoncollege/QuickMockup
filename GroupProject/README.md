### GroupProject

The Team Enterprise Java Project is designed to simulate a real world project in which team members contribute to a single software product. The product must be a significant web service or reusable library that could be used in the Individual Projects for this course. This means the consumers of the service or library will include developers outside of the project team. Upon completion, this project will be an important part of the studentâ€™s portfolio to be shared with potential employers.   

Team format will be self-selected teams of 3.

All team members must contribute to project source code, have a good understanding of all aspects of the project, and be able to provide support as individuals begin using the software in their own development. 

#### Deliverables

* Problem statement, project objectives, and project plan (detailed schedule for the project). Must be approved by the instructor.
* Regular (minimum of weekly) journal/blog/wiki entries documenting progress, obstacles, findings, learning points. Although commit logs will show who did what, please also include this information at a high level in the progress log.
* Source code, HTML JavaDoc and all supporting materials published on GitHub.
* User documentation for the targeted end users published on GitHub.
* Presentation of the finished product to the class. Format TBD - these will likely be small, informal presentations among the teams. 

#### Rubric

| Category  | Excellent |   Good    |   Fair    |   Poor    |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Project effectively utilizes the technologies and techniques specified in the project objectives (35%)| Completely fulfills or exceeds project scope. (12-14) | Fulfilled most of the scope. (11-12) | Fulfilled some significant portions of the project scope. (9-11) | Barely fulfilled the scope: significant portions are missing. (0-9) |
| Teamwork (20%) | Workload was balanced among team members, all team members have an excellent understanding of the product, and can answer most technical questions about the product. Demonstates initiative and thoughtful planning. Milestones were met. (7-8) | Workload was mostly balanced among team members, all team members have a good understanding of, and can answer many technical questions about, the product. Demonstrates some planning and initiative, but a milestone might have been missed slightly. (6-7)| Workload appears to be unbalanced across the team. One team member cannot effectively explain the product to others. Demonstrates some planning but missed milestones. (4-6)| It appears that one person did all of the work and/or only one team member is able to effectively explain and answer questions about the project. Appears to have involved minimal planning, missed milestones or failed to reach potential due to underutilized resources. (0-4)|
| Code is readable, documented, efficient and well-tested. (15%) | Code is exceptionally well organized and easy to follow. Documentation is well written and clearly explains what the code is accomplishing and how. Code is extremely efficient without sacrificing readability/maintainability. Code has significant test coverage. (5.5-6) |  Code is fairly easy to follow. Documentation is somewhat useful in understanding the code. Code is efficient. Moderate test coverage. (4.5-5.5) | Code is fairly easy to follow with some exceptions. Documentation is incomplete. Code inefficiencies exist. Some test coverage. (3-4.5) | Code is poorly organized; documentation is simply embedded comments and does not help the reader understand the code; code is unnecessarily long and complex. Little to no test coverage. (0-3) |
| Evidence of significant revision and incorporation of feedback. (10%) | Evidence of significant revision and incorporation of feedback that results in significant improvement. (4) | Evidence of some revision and incorporation of feedback that results in some improvement. (3) | Evidence of minor revision only and incorporation of feedback that results in minimal improvement. (2) | Project appears to have undergone little to no revision or incorporation of feedback. (0-1) |  
| Complexity (10%) | Complex (4) | Difficult (3) | Average (2) | Simple (0-1) |
| User Documentation (10%) | Documentation is complete and very thorough. (4) | Documentation is mostly complete. (3) | Documentation is missing a few components. (2) | User documentation is missing some critical components. (0-1) |
